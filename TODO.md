# PDFSmaller Frontend - Architecture Compliance TODO

## Overview
This TODO tracks the migration from the old "compression-monolithic" architecture to the new **event-driven, service-centric architecture** as defined in the steering documents.

## Phase 1: Architecture Audit and Planning âœ…

- [x] Read and analyze all steering documents in `.kiro/steering/`
- [x] Understand the event-driven, service-centric architecture requirements
- [x] Identify current project structure and components
- [x] Document current state vs. target architecture

## Phase 2: Service Architecture Implementation

### Core Service Infrastructure
- [ ] Audit existing services against StandardService specification
  - [ ] Review `js/services/standard-service.js` compliance
  - [ ] Ensure all services extend StandardService with proper event emission
  - [ ] Implement missing service methods (emitProgress, emitComplete, emitError, etc.)

### Storage Service Compliance
- [ ] Review `js/services/storage-service.js` implementation
  - [ ] Ensure single source of truth for files
  - [ ] Verify encryption and metadata handling
  - [ ] Check event emission for file operations
  - [ ] Test storage quota handling

### Compression Service Architecture
- [ ] Review `js/services/compression-service.js`
  - [ ] Ensure proper event-driven progress reporting
  - [ ] Verify batch processing capabilities
  - [ ] Check integration with StorageService via events

### Additional Services Implementation
- [ ] Review ConversionService (`js/services/conversion-service.js`)
- [ ] Review OCRService implementation
- [ ] Review AIService (`js/services/ai-service.js`)
- [ ] Review AnalyticsService
- [ ] Ensure SecurityService compliance

## Phase 3: Component Architecture Compliance

### Component Isolation Audit
- [ ] Audit FileUploader component (`js/components/file-uploader.js`)
  - [ ] Remove any business logic
  - [ ] Ensure event-only communication
  - [ ] Verify it only handles UI and emits events

- [ ] Audit FileManager component (`js/components/file-manager.js`)
  - [ ] Ensure it requests files via events (not direct StorageService calls)
  - [ ] Check for proper event emission for file operations
  - [ ] Remove any direct service access

- [ ] Audit CompressionInterface component
  - [ ] Verify no direct compression logic
  - [ ] Ensure proper event emission for compression requests

- [ ] Audit ProgressTracker component (`js/components/progress-tracker.js`)
  - [ ] Check event-driven progress updates
  - [ ] Ensure no direct service communication

- [ ] Audit ResultsDisplay component (`js/components/results-display.js`)
  - [ ] Verify event-driven result display
  - [ ] Check download functionality uses events

### Component Communication Patterns
- [ ] Remove all direct component-to-component method calls
- [ ] Implement event-only communication between components
- [ ] Ensure components emit events instead of calling service methods directly

## Phase 4: MainController Implementation

### Central Event Orchestrator
- [ ] Review/enhance `js/controllers/main-controller.js`
  - [ ] Ensure it handles all component events
  - [ ] Verify service coordination through events
  - [ ] Check proper event routing and state management

- [ ] Implement event handling patterns:
  - [ ] `fileUploaded` event handling
  - [ ] `compressionRequested` event handling
  - [ ] `conversionRequested` event handling
  - [ ] Service progress/complete/error event handling

### Service Registry and Coordination
- [ ] Implement service registry in MainController
- [ ] Set up service-to-service communication via controller
- [ ] Ensure proper service initialization and lifecycle management

## Phase 5: Event System Implementation

### Component Event Interfaces
- [ ] Standardize event naming conventions across components
- [ ] Implement consistent event detail structures
- [ ] Add proper event documentation

### Service Event Interfaces
- [ ] Ensure all services emit standardized events:
  - [ ] `progress` events with percentage and message
  - [ ] `complete` events with results
  - [ ] `error` events with proper error context
  - [ ] `statusChanged` events for service state

## Phase 6: UI Integration and Testing

### Integration Service
- [ ] Review `js/services/ui-integration-service.js`
  - [ ] Ensure proper component discovery and registration
  - [ ] Verify event routing between components and services
  - [ ] Check state management integration

### Authentication Integration
- [ ] Review auth components and services
  - [ ] Ensure event-driven authentication flow
  - [ ] Check integration with main application state

### Navigation and Tab System
- [ ] Review tab navigation implementation
  - [ ] Ensure proper event handling for tab switches
  - [ ] Check component lifecycle management

## Phase 7: Testing Implementation

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Review existing test files:
  - [ ] `js/components/file-uploader.test.js`
  - [ ] `js/services/storage-service.test.js`
- [ ] Add missing unit tests for services
- [ ] Add component event emission tests
- [ ] Test service event handling

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete file upload to compression workflow
- [ ] Test event flow from components through controller to services
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery scenarios

## Phase 8: Performance and Quality

### Code Quality
- [ ] Run ESLint to check ES6 module compliance
- [ ] Ensure no external UI frameworks are used
- [ ] Check for proper error handling patterns

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Review component loading and initialization
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in event handling
- [ ] Optimize service communication patterns

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update component documentation to reflect event-driven patterns
- [ ] Document service APIs and event interfaces
- [ ] Create integration examples

## Phase 9: Final Validation

### Architecture Compliance Check
- [ ] Verify no components contain business logic
- [ ] Confirm all service communication goes through events
- [ ] Check that MainController properly orchestrates all interactions
- [ ] Validate service interfaces follow StandardService pattern

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Test complete user workflows
- [ ] Verify file processing pipeline works correctly
- [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery
- [ ] Validate responsive design and accessibility

### Deployment Readiness
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are properly imported as ES6 modules
- [ ] Check that all components are properly registered
- [ ] Validate production build compatibility

## Current Status
**Phase**: Starting Phase 2 - Service Architecture Implementation
**Priority**: Audit and fix service implementations to comply with StandardService specification

## Notes
- Focus on modifying existing code rather than adding new features
- Maintain existing functionality while implementing architectural changes
- Event-driven architecture is the primary goal
- All business logic must reside in services, not components
