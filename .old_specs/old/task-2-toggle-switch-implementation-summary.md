# Task 2: Toggle Switch UI Component Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the toggle switch UI component within the FileUploader component to support dual-mode functionality (single file vs batch files mode).

## Implementation Details

### 1. Toggle Switch HTML Structure ✅
- Added `renderToggleSwitch()` method that generates the complete toggle switch HTML
- Includes proper semantic structure with:
  - Toggle container with labels
  - Switch button with ARIA attributes
  - Mode description text
  - Proper CSS classes for styling and state management

### 2. CSS Styles with Smooth Animations ✅
- Comprehensive CSS styling added to `getStyles()` method including:
  - **Toggle Container**: Flexbox layout with proper spacing and background
  - **Toggle Switch**: 52px × 28px switch with rounded track and thumb
  - **Smooth Animations**: 300ms transitions for all state changes
  - **Hover Effects**: Scale and shadow effects on interaction
  - **Active States**: Visual feedback for click/press interactions
  - **Disabled States**: Proper opacity and pointer-events handling
  - **Mode-specific Styling**: Different visual indicators for single vs batch mode

### 3. Mode Labels with Proper Positioning ✅
- "Single File" and "Batch Files" labels positioned on either side of the toggle
- Labels change color and weight based on active mode
- Proper spacing and alignment using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Responsive design considerations

### 4. Toggle Click Event Handler ✅
- `handleToggleClick()` method handles mouse clicks
- Prevents default behavior and event bubbling
- Checks for disabled state before processing
- Calls `toggleMode()` method to switch between modes
- Updates ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Provides screen reader announcements

### 5. Keyboard Navigation Support ✅
- `handleToggleKeydown()` method handles keyboard interactions
- Supports Space and Enter keys for activation
- Same functionality as click handler
- Proper event prevention and accessibility updates

## Key Features Implemented

### Accessibility Features
- **ARIA Attributes**: `role="switch"`, `aria-checked`, `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`
- **Screen Reader Support**: `announceToScreenReader()` method for mode change announcements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with Tab, Space, and Enter keys
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus indicators and tabindex handling
- **High Contrast Support**: CSS designed to work in high contrast mode

### State Management
- Toggle state synchronized with component mode
- Proper disabled state handling
- Transition state management to prevent rapid toggling
- Session preference integration

### Visual Design
- Modern toggle switch design with smooth animations
- Clear visual feedback for all states (normal, hover, active, disabled)
- Mode-specific styling for upload area
- Consistent with existing component design system

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks in all methods
- Graceful fallback for rendering errors
- Console logging for debugging
- Proper error recovery

## Files Modified
- `js/components/file-uploader.js` - Main implementation

## Files Created
- `test-toggle-switch.html` - Test page for toggle functionality
- `validate-toggle-implementation.js` - Validation script

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 1.1 ✅
Toggle switch displays in component header and switches between modes

### Requirement 2.1 ✅ 
Component clearly indicates current mode with labels and visual feedback

### Requirement 2.2 ✅
Mode labels update appropriately ("Single File" / "Batch Files")

### Requirement 5.1 ✅
Toggle switch is focusable using Tab key

### Requirement 5.2 ✅
Space and Enter keys activate the toggle

### Requirement 6.1 ✅

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test page with multiple scenarios
- Tests basic toggle functionality
- Tests disabled state
- Tests legacy multiple attribute compatibility
- Tests programmatic API methods

## Next Steps
The toggle switch UI component is now complete and ready for integration with the remaining dual-mode functionality. The next task should focus on implementing mode-specific UI rendering and instructions (Task 3).
