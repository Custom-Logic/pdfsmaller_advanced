## Summary

### Total Estimated Time: 28 hours

### Phase Breakdown:
- **Phase 1 (Critical)**: 7 hours - Shadow DOM migration
- **Phase 2 (High)**: 6 hours - State management integration  
- **Phase 3 (High)**: 6.5 hours - Functionality restoration
- **Phase 4 (Medium)**: 5 hours - Polish and optimization
- **Quality Assurance**: 4 hours - Testing and documentation

### Critical Path Dependencies:
1. **Tasks 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3**: Shadow DOM foundation must be completed first
2. **Tasks 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3**: State management must follow shadow DOM
3. **Tasks 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 → 3.4**: Functionality restoration is sequential
4. **Phase 4 tasks**: Can be parallelized after Phase 3 completion

### Risk Mitigation:
- Test each task completion before moving to next task
- Use existing test harness for regression testing
- Maintain backup of working version for rollback
- Validate MainController integration after each phase
