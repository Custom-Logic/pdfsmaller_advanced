## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1. Component API Contract

**Public Methods (MUST MAINTAIN):**
```javascript
// File list management
updateFiles(files: Array<FileObject>) -> void
showError(error: Error) -> void
refresh() -> void

// State management (inherited from BaseComponent)
setState(newState: Object) -> void
getState(key?: string) -> any

// Event emission (inherited from BaseComponent)
emit(eventName: string, detail: any) -> boolean
```

**Event Interface (MUST MAINTAIN):**
```javascript
// Outbound events
CustomEvent('requestFileList', { detail: { timestamp: number } })
CustomEvent('fileDownloadRequested', { detail: { fileId: string } })
CustomEvent('fileDeleteRequested', { detail: { fileId: string } })
CustomEvent('clearAllFilesRequested', { detail: { fileCount: number } })
```

### 3.2. Shadow DOM Template Structure

**Required Template Sections:**
```html
<div class="file-manager">
  <div class="file-manager-header">...</div>
  <div class="file-manager-toolbar">...</div>  
  <div class="file-manager-content">...</div>
</div>
```

**State-Driven Content Sections:**
- Loading state template
- Error state template  
- Empty state template
- File list template
- Storage info template

### 3.3. State Management Structure

**Required State Properties:**
```javascript
{
  files: Array<FileObject>,
  isLoading: boolean,
  error: string|null,
  searchQuery: string,
  filterType: 'all'|'original'|'processed',

```

### 3.4. CSS Architecture

**Required CSS Custom Properties:**
```css
--file-manager-bg: var(--card-bg)
--file-manager-border: var(--border-color)
