### 2. Enhanced Compression Routes (`src/routes/enhanced_compression_routes.py`)

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/enhanced/compress/intelligent` - Intelligent compression with AI recommendations
- `POST /api/enhanced/compress/analyze` - PDF analysis for compression potential
- `POST /api/enhanced/compress/batch` - Batch compression processing
- `GET /api/enhanced/compress/batch/<id>/status` - Batch job status
- `GET /api/enhanced/compress/history` - Compression history
- `POST /api/enhanced/compress/preview` - Compression preview

- `POST /api/enhanced/compress/compare` - Settings comparison
- `GET /api/enhanced/compress/health` - Service health check

## Integration

### Enhanced Compression Integration (`js/integration/enhanced-compression.js`)

**Features:**
- Seamless integration with existing interface
- Automatic file analysis on selection
- Compression preview updates
- Mode switching between single and bulk processing
- Error handling and user feedback

**Integration Points:**
- File selection handling
- Settings synchronization
- Progress tracking
- Results display
- Download functionality

## Usage

### Single File Compression

1. **File Selection**: Upload a PDF file through the existing interface
2. **Automatic Analysis**: The system automatically analyzes the file and shows recommendations
3. **Settings Configuration**: Use the settings panel to adjust compression parameters
4. **Compression**: Click compress to process with intelligent settings
5. **Results**: View compression results and download the compressed file

### Bulk File Compression

1. **Mode Toggle**: Switch to bulk mode using the toggle switch
2. **File Upload**: Drag and drop multiple PDF files (up to 20)
3. **Settings**: Configure compression settings for the entire batch
4. **Processing**: Start batch compression
5. **Results**: View batch results with success/failure status for each file

### AI Recommendations

1. **Analysis**: The system analyzes each PDF for optimal compression settings
2. **Recommendations**: View AI-powered recommendations in the settings panel
3. **Application**: One-click application of recommended settings
4. **Customization**: Override recommendations with custom settings as needed

## Technical Details

### Frontend Architecture

- **ES6 Modules**: All new components use modern JavaScript modules
- **Web Components**: Custom elements for reusable UI components
- **Shadow DOM**: Encapsulated styling and functionality
- **Event-Driven**: Component communication through custom events

### Backend Architecture

- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking PDF analysis and compression
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation of business logic
- **Caching**: Analysis results cached for performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Performance Features

- **Client-Side Analysis**: PDF analysis performed in browser when possible
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Server-side processing only when needed
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple files
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for long operations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Upload folder for temporary files
UPLOAD_FOLDER=/tmp/pdf_uploads

# Maximum file size (in bytes)
MAX_FILE_SIZE=104857600

# Analysis cache size
ANALYSIS_CACHE_SIZE=1000
```

### Dependencies

**Frontend:**
- PDF-lib for PDF manipulation
- Modern browser with ES6+ support

**Backend:**
- pdfinfo command-line tool
- Ghostscript for PDF processing
- Python 3.8+ with async support

## Testing

### Frontend Tests

```bash
# Run component tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=components

# Run service tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=services
```

### Backend Tests

```bash
# Run enhanced compression tests
python -m pytest tests/test_enhanced_compression_service.py -v

# Run route tests
python -m pytest tests/test_enhanced_compression_routes.py -v
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Real-time learning from compression results
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed compression performance metrics
3. **Cloud Processing**: Distributed compression across multiple servers
4. **Format Support**: Additional input/output format support
5. **API Rate Limiting**: Advanced rate limiting based on user tiers

### Performance Improvements

1. **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent file processing
2. **Streaming**: Large file streaming for memory efficiency
3. **Caching**: Redis-based caching for analysis results
4. **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery for compressed files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Analysis Fails**: Check if pdfinfo and Ghostscript are installed
2. **Client Compression Unavailable**: Ensure PDF-lib is loaded correctly
3. **Batch Processing Errors**: Verify file size and count limits
4. **Settings Not Applied**: Check browser localStorage support

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see detailed logging:

```javascript
// Frontend
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');

// Backend
export FLASK_ENV=development
```
