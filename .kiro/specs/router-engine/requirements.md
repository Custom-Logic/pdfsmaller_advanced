# Router Engine Requirements

## 1. Core Functionality

- The router engine must manage navigation between different views or pages within the application.
- It should be implemented as a service named `RouterService`.
- The router must support hash-based routing (e.g., `index.html#home`, `index.html#settings`).
- It should be possible to define routes and associate them with specific UI components or views.
- The router must provide a way to navigate to a specific route programmatically.

## 2. Integration with the Application

- The `RouterService` must be integrated into the `MainController`.
- It should listen for navigation events and update the view accordingly.
- UI components should be able to trigger navigation by emitting events.
- The router should be able to pass parameters to views (e.g., `index.html#user/123`).

## 3. User Experience

- The router should provide a smooth and responsive navigation experience.
- It should handle invalid or non-existent routes gracefully, for example by redirecting to a default "not found" page.
- The router should update the browser's history, allowing the use of the back and forward buttons.

## 4. Technical Requirements

- The `RouterService` must be implemented in vanilla JavaScript, following the project's coding standards.
- It must extend the `StandardService` base class.
- The router should be lightweight and have minimal performance overhead.
- It must be well-tested with unit and integration tests.
