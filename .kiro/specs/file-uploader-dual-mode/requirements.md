# File Uploader Dual-Mode Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the enhancement of the existing file uploader component to support both single and batch upload modes through an internal toggle switch. The enhancement will provide users with the flexibility to switch between uploading one file at a time or multiple files in batch, all within a single, self-contained component.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between single file and batch file upload modes within the uploader component, so that I can choose the appropriate upload method for my current task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the file uploader component is rendered THEN it SHALL display a toggle switch in the component header
2. WHEN the toggle is in the OFF position THEN the component SHALL operate in single file mode
3. WHEN the toggle is in the ON position THEN the component SHALL operate in batch files mode
4. WHEN I click the toggle switch THEN the component SHALL immediately switch between modes without requiring a page refresh
5. WHEN the mode changes THEN the component SHALL update its UI to reflect the current mode capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the uploader component to clearly indicate which mode I'm currently in, so that I understand the upload behavior and limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is in single file mode THEN it SHALL display "Single File" label and appropriate messaging
2. WHEN the component is in batch files mode THEN it SHALL display "Batch Files" label and appropriate messaging
3. WHEN in single file mode THEN the drag-drop area SHALL indicate single file acceptance
4. WHEN in batch files mode THEN the drag-drop area SHALL indicate multiple file acceptance
5. WHEN the mode changes THEN the upload instructions SHALL update to match the current mode

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the file selection behavior to adapt to the current mode, so that the component enforces the appropriate file limits automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in single file mode AND I select multiple files THEN the component SHALL only accept the last selected file
2. WHEN in single file mode AND I drag multiple files THEN the component SHALL only accept one file
3. WHEN in batch files mode THEN the component SHALL accept multiple files as expected
4. WHEN switching from batch to single mode AND multiple files are selected THEN the component SHALL keep only the first file
5. WHEN switching from single to batch mode THEN the component SHALL maintain the currently selected file

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced component to maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations, so that no changes are required in parent components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is used without specifying a default mode THEN it SHALL default to single file mode
2. WHEN the component receives the existing `multiple` attribute THEN it SHALL set the initial toggle state accordingly
3. WHEN the component emits events THEN it SHALL use the same event names and data structure as before
4. WHEN parent components call existing methods THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
5. WHEN the component is initialized THEN it SHALL accept a `default-mode` attribute to set the initial state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the toggle switch to be accessible and keyboard navigable, so that I can use the component regardless of my interaction method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate with the keyboard THEN the toggle switch SHALL be focusable using Tab key
2. WHEN the toggle has focus AND I press Space or Enter THEN it SHALL switch modes
3. WHEN the toggle state changes THEN screen readers SHALL announce the new mode
4. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the toggle SHALL remain clearly visible
5. WHEN the component is disabled THEN the toggle SHALL also be disabled and non-interactive

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback when switching modes, so that I can clearly see the mode change has taken effect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the toggle THEN there SHALL be a smooth visual transition between states
2. WHEN the mode changes THEN the upload area SHALL animate to reflect the new capabilities
3. WHEN switching to batch mode THEN additional UI elements for batch handling SHALL appear smoothly
4. WHEN switching to single mode THEN batch-specific UI elements SHALL disappear smoothly
5. WHEN the toggle animates THEN it SHALL provide clear visual feedback of the current state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to programmatically control the toggle state, so that I can set the mode based on application logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `setMode('single')` THEN the component SHALL switch to single file mode
2. WHEN I call `setMode('batch')` THEN the component SHALL switch to batch files mode
3. WHEN I call `getMode()` THEN it SHALL return the current mode ('single' or 'batch')
4. WHEN the mode is changed programmatically THEN the toggle UI SHALL update to reflect the new state
5. WHEN the mode is changed programmatically THEN appropriate events SHALL be emitted

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the component to remember my mode preference during the session, so that I don't have to repeatedly set my preferred mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch to batch mode THEN the component SHALL remember this preference for the session
2. WHEN I switch to single mode THEN the component SHALL remember this preference for the session
3. WHEN a new instance of the component is created in the same session THEN it SHALL use the last selected mode
4. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the component SHALL revert to the default mode
5. WHEN the `remember-preference` attribute is set to false THEN the component SHALL not remember the mode preference
