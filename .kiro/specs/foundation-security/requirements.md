# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers Phase 1 of the PDFSmaller modernization project, focusing on Foundation & Security improvements. The goal is to restructure the frontend with modern JavaScript modules and implement comprehensive security enhancements including end-to-end encryption and secure file handling. This phase establishes the foundation for intelligent processing while ensuring the highest security standards for user data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Modernization with ES6 Modules

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend codebase to use modern JavaScript modules and components, so that the code is maintainable, scalable, and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend directory is restructured THEN it SHALL follow the modular architecture with separate folders for modules, components, services, and utils
2. WHEN JavaScript code is refactored THEN it SHALL use ES6+ syntax including modules, async/await, and modern Web APIs
3. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be reusable Web Components using the Custom Elements API
4. WHEN modules are imported THEN they SHALL use ES6 import/export syntax with proper dependency management
5. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL support dynamic imports for code splitting and lazy loading

### Requirement 2: Reusable UI Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent and intuitive interface with smooth interactions, so that I can easily upload files and track progress without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with the file uploader THEN it SHALL support drag & drop functionality with visual feedback
2. WHEN files are being processed THEN the progress bar SHALL show real-time updates with percentage and estimated time
3. WHEN compression results are available THEN the results panel SHALL display original size, compressed size, and reduction percentage clearly
4. WHEN I adjust compression settings THEN the settings panel SHALL provide intuitive controls with immediate preview of changes
5. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL be responsive and work consistently across different screen sizes

### Requirement 3: End-to-End Encryption Implementation

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want my files to be encrypted during transmission and storage, so that my sensitive documents remain secure throughout the processing pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is selected for upload THEN it SHALL be encrypted on the client-side using Web Crypto API before transmission
2. WHEN encrypted files are transmitted THEN they SHALL use secure HTTPS connections with proper certificate validation
3. WHEN files are stored on the server THEN they SHALL remain encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms
4. WHEN encryption keys are generated THEN they SHALL use cryptographically secure random number generation
5. WHEN files are decrypted THEN it SHALL only occur during active processing and keys SHALL be securely managed

### Requirement 4: Secure File Handling System

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want assurance that my files are automatically deleted after processing, so that no traces of my documents remain on the server longer than necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL schedule automatic deletion within a configurable time limit (default 2 hours)
2. WHEN file processing is complete THEN the original encrypted file SHALL be immediately marked for deletion
3. WHEN files are deleted THEN the deletion SHALL be cryptographically secure and unrecoverable
4. WHEN file operations occur THEN they SHALL be logged in an audit trail with timestamps and user identification
5. WHEN storage cleanup runs THEN it SHALL verify that no orphaned files remain beyond the retention policy

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Audit Logging

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want detailed audit logs of all file operations, so that I can verify the system meets security and privacy regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL log the event with user ID, file hash, timestamp, and encryption status
2. WHEN processing starts THEN the system SHALL log the job initiation with processing parameters and security settings
3. WHEN files are accessed THEN the system SHALL log all access attempts including successful and failed operations
4. WHEN files are deleted THEN the system SHALL log the deletion event with verification of secure erasure
5. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN they SHALL be tamper-evident and stored securely with proper retention policies

### Requirement 6: Client-Side Security Services

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust client-side security utilities, so that encryption and security operations are handled consistently and securely across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security keys are generated THEN the SecurityService SHALL use Web Crypto API with appropriate key lengths and algorithms
2. WHEN files are encrypted THEN the process SHALL use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM) with unique initialization vectors
3. WHEN encrypted data is transmitted THEN it SHALL include integrity verification to detect tampering
4. WHEN security operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN security services are used THEN they SHALL follow secure coding practices and prevent common vulnerabilities

### Requirement 7: Progressive Enhancement Architecture

**User Story:** As a user with varying browser capabilities, I want the application to work on my device regardless of JavaScript support level, so that I can access basic functionality even with limited browser features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the application SHALL provide basic file upload functionality through standard HTML forms
2. WHEN modern JavaScript features are available THEN the application SHALL enhance the experience with advanced interactions
3. WHEN Web Components are not supported THEN the application SHALL gracefully degrade to standard HTML elements
4. WHEN advanced APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative implementations or clear messaging about limitations
5. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL detect browser capabilities and adapt the interface accordingly

### Requirement 8: Security Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable security settings, so that I can adjust encryption parameters and retention policies based on organizational requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security settings are configured THEN they SHALL be validated against security best practices and compliance requirements
2. WHEN encryption algorithms are selected THEN the system SHALL support multiple approved algorithms with secure defaults
3. WHEN retention policies are set THEN they SHALL be enforced automatically with proper validation of time limits
4. WHEN security configurations change THEN existing files SHALL be handled according to the most restrictive policy
5. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail securely and log the issues for administrator review
