# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will reorganize the PDFSmaller application's UI to improve usability and fix critical visibility issues. The current implementation has compression settings mixed within the compression tab, dark backgrounds that obscure content, poor text contrast, and a non-functional hamburger menu. This reorganization will move compression settings to a dedicated settings tab, remove problematic dark overlays, fix text visibility issues, and implement proper hamburger menu functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want compression settings to be located in a dedicated Settings tab rather than mixed with the compression interface, so that I can configure my preferences separately from the actual compression workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on the Settings tab THEN the system SHALL display all compression-related settings (Processing Mode, Compression Level, Image Quality, Use Server Processing)
2. WHEN the Settings tab is active THEN the system SHALL show a clean settings interface without dark backgrounds
3. WHEN I change settings in the Settings tab THEN the system SHALL apply these settings to compression operations in the Compress tab
4. WHEN I switch from Settings to Compress tab THEN the system SHALL maintain my selected settings
5. WHEN the Compress tab is active THEN the system SHALL NOT display compression settings controls, only the file upload and processing interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Settings component to have a clean, readable interface without dark backgrounds, so that I can easily see and interact with all settings options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Settings tab is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a light background without dark overlays
2. WHEN the Settings panel is shown THEN the system SHALL have proper contrast between text and background
3. WHEN settings controls are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the rest of the application
4. WHEN I interact with settings controls THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback without dark backgrounds interfering
5. WHEN the settings are saved THEN the system SHALL show confirmation without dark overlay popups

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the File Uploader component to have a clean appearance without dark backgrounds, so that I can clearly see the upload area and instructions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the file upload area is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a light background without dark overlays
2. WHEN I drag files over the upload area THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with appropriate contrast
3. WHEN the upload area is in different states (default, hover, dragover) THEN the system SHALL maintain good visibility without dark backgrounds
4. WHEN upload progress is shown THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators clearly without dark overlays
5. WHEN upload errors occur THEN the system SHALL show error messages with proper contrast and visibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface title and subtitle text to be clearly visible against the background, so that I can read all interface elements without strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display title text with sufficient contrast against the background
2. WHEN subtitle text is shown THEN the system SHALL ensure it's clearly readable and not white-on-white
3. WHEN interface labels are displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate text colors for maximum readability
4. WHEN text overlays backgrounds THEN the system SHALL ensure proper contrast ratios meet accessibility standards
5. WHEN different UI states are active THEN the system SHALL maintain text visibility across all states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the hamburger menu to be functional and responsive, so that I can access navigation options on mobile devices and smaller screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the hamburger menu button THEN the system SHALL open/close the navigation menu
2. WHEN the hamburger menu is open THEN the system SHALL display navigation options clearly
3. WHEN I click outside the open menu THEN the system SHALL close the menu automatically
4. WHEN the menu is open THEN the system SHALL prevent background scrolling
5. WHEN I click a menu item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate section and close the menu
6. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL show/hide the hamburger menu appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Compress tab to focus solely on file upload and processing workflow, so that I can have a clean, uncluttered compression interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Compress tab is active THEN the system SHALL display only the file upload area and processing controls
2. WHEN files are being processed THEN the system SHALL show progress tracking and results without settings controls
3. WHEN compression is complete THEN the system SHALL display results and download options clearly
4. WHEN I need to change settings THEN the system SHALL direct me to the Settings tab or provide a quick link
5. WHEN the compression workflow is active THEN the system SHALL maintain focus on the task without settings distractions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual styling across all tabs and components, so that the application feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and color schemes
2. WHEN components are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same design patterns and visual elements
3. WHEN interactive elements are shown THEN the system SHALL have consistent hover and active states
4. WHEN forms and controls are displayed THEN the system SHALL follow the same design system
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL present a unified visual experience across all sections

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper responsive behavior across all screen sizes, so that the application works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display the hamburger menu and hide full navigation
2. WHEN viewed on desktop THEN the system SHALL show full navigation and hide the hamburger menu
3. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
4. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and interactions
5. WHEN orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality and readability

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback for all interactive elements, so that I understand what actions are available and what state the application is in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear hover states
2. WHEN elements are focused THEN the system SHALL show appropriate focus indicators
3. WHEN buttons are clicked THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL show loading or processing states
5. WHEN actions complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear success or error feedback

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the settings to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure my preferences every time I use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change settings THEN the system SHALL save them to local storage
2. WHEN I reload the page THEN the system SHALL restore my previous settings
3. WHEN I return to the application later THEN the system SHALL remember my compression preferences
4. WHEN settings are restored THEN the system SHALL apply them to the appropriate UI controls
5. WHEN I clear browser data THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle missing settings with sensible defaults
