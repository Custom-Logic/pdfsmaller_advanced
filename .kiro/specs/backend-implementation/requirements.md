# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PDFSmaller application currently has a basic PDF compression backend service, but it's missing several critical features that are referenced in the frontend application and API documentation. This backend implementation project aims to complete the missing functionality to provide a full-featured PDF compression service with user authentication, subscription management, bulk processing, and enhanced security features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and log in to access premium features and track my compression history, so that I can have a personalized experience and access advanced functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with encrypted password storage
2. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and return a JWT token
3. WHEN a user requests their profile information THEN the system SHALL return user details excluding sensitive information
4. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
5. WHEN a user provides an invalid JWT token THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 2: Subscription Management System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to subscribe to premium plans to access enhanced compression features and higher usage limits, so that I can get better value from the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a subscription THEN the system SHALL integrate with a payment processor and store subscription details
2. WHEN a user cancels their subscription THEN the system SHALL process the cancellation and update their access level
3. WHEN a user requests subscription information THEN the system SHALL return current plan details and usage statistics
4. WHEN a subscription expires THEN the system SHALL automatically downgrade user access to free tier
5. WHEN a premium user exceeds their plan limits THEN the system SHALL enforce usage restrictions

### Requirement 3: Bulk PDF Processing

**User Story:** As a premium user, I want to compress multiple PDF files at once, so that I can efficiently process large batches of documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a premium user uploads multiple PDF files THEN the system SHALL process all files with the specified compression settings
2. WHEN bulk processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates for the batch operation
3. WHEN bulk processing completes THEN the system SHALL return a compressed archive containing all processed files
4. WHEN a free user attempts bulk processing THEN the system SHALL restrict access and suggest upgrading to premium
5. WHEN bulk processing fails for any file THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining files and report errors

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Security and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security measures and rate limiting to protect the service from abuse and ensure fair usage, so that the service remains stable and secure for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user makes requests THEN the system SHALL enforce appropriate rate limits based on user tier
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL implement additional security measures
3. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file types, sizes, and scan for malicious content
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up temporary files within specified timeframes
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security events without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 5: Database Integration and Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my account information, subscription details, and usage history to be securely stored and retrievable, so that I can track my usage and maintain my account settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL use secure database practices with proper encryption
2. WHEN user requests their data THEN the system SHALL retrieve information efficiently with proper indexing
3. WHEN data needs to be updated THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity with proper transaction handling
4. WHEN users delete their accounts THEN the system SHALL properly remove all associated data
5. WHEN the system starts up THEN the database SHALL be properly initialized with required tables and constraints

### Requirement 6: File Management and Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded and processed files to be handled securely with automatic cleanup, so that my data privacy is protected and storage costs are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them in secure temporary locations with unique identifiers
2. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL make compressed files available for download for a limited time
3. WHEN the retention period expires THEN the system SHALL automatically delete all associated files
4. WHEN storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup policies to maintain available space
5. WHEN files are accessed THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions and file ownership

### Requirement 7: API Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer and system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging to troubleshoot issues and monitor system health, so that I can maintain service reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive error messages
2. WHEN system events happen THEN the system SHALL log relevant information for monitoring and debugging
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN API responses are sent THEN the system SHALL include proper headers and follow REST conventions
5. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive information while maintaining useful debugging data
