# Gap Analysis Summary

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the findings of the architectural investigation. The goal was to identify components and workflows that are not aligned with the project's new event-driven, service-centric architecture. 

The investigation reveals that while several modern components and services are correctly implemented, critical gaps exist in the integration layer and in key legacy components, preventing the application from functioning as a cohesive whole.

### Status Legend
- 游릭 **Aligned:** Conforms to the target architecture.
- 游리 **Minor Gap:** Mostly aligned, but requires specific integration or minor refactoring.
- 游댮 **Major Gap:** Does not conform to the target architecture; requires significant refactoring.

| Area Investigated           | Status | Key Issue                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | :----: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Navigation System           |   游댮   | Main side-nav is non-functional; lacks event-driven mechanism.             |
| FileUploader Component      |   游댮   | Primary uploader is hidden by CSS; monolithic bulk-uploader is used instead. |
| Service Control Panels      |   游리   | `convert`, `ocr`, `ai` panels are correct. `compress` panel is missing.      |
| Progress & Status           |   游릭   | Aligned. Excellent implementation of the target architecture.              |
| Auth & Profile Flow         |   游리   | Service and components are correct, but the UI does not react to state changes. |
| FileManager Component       |   游릭   | Aligned. Excellent implementation of the target architecture.              |

## 2. Detailed Findings

### 2.1. Navigation System
- **Severity:** Major
- **Issue:** The main side-menu (hamburger menu) is not a true navigation system. It does not contain navigation links and relies on direct DOM manipulation (`.classList.toggle`) to control its visibility, violating the event-driven pattern.
- **Recommendation:** Implement the `docs/NAVIGATION_SPECIFICATION.md`. Populate the menu with links that dispatch a `navigationRequested` event, to be handled by the main controller.

### 2.2. FileUploader Component
- **Severity:** Major
- **Issue 1:** The architecturally-correct `<file-uploader>` component is globally hidden by a `display: none;` rule in the project's CSS, rendering it unusable on the Convert, OCR, and AI tabs.
- **Issue 2:** The primary "Compress" tab uses a monolithic `<bulk-uploader>` component that manages its own state and uses direct callbacks (`onBatchStart`) instead of emitting events.
- **Issue 3:** A duplicate file, `file-uploader-refactored.js`, exists. This is a critical issue that can lead to unpredictable behavior.
- **Recommendation:** 
    1. Delete `js/components/file-uploader-refactored.js`.
    2. Remove the `display: none;` style from the `file-uploader` element in the CSS.
    3. Deprecate and refactor the `<bulk-uploader>` to use a standard `<file-uploader>` and delegate actions to a proper control panel.

### 2.3. Service Control Panels
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Issue:** The application lacks a dedicated, event-driven control panel for its primary "Compress" feature. The action button is incorrectly located within the `<bulk-uploader>`.
- **Recommendation:** Create a new `<compression-controls>` component that follows the `docs/SERVICE_CONTROL_SPECIFICATION.md`. This component will be responsible for gathering settings and emitting a `serviceStartRequest` event.

### 2.4. Authentication & User Profile Flow
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Issue:** The `AuthManager` service correctly emits an `authStateChanged` event, but no module is listening for it. As a result, the UI does not update after login or logout.
- **Recommendation:** The `main-integration.js` module must add an event listener for `authStateChanged` and handle the UI updates as prescribed in `docs/AUTH_INTEGRATION_SPECIFICATION.md`.

### 2.5. Progress & Status / FileManager
- **Severity:** None
- **Issue:** No architectural issues were found.
- **Recommendation:** These systems are well-designed and should be used as the "gold standard" and primary reference for all other refactoring work.

## 3. Conclusion

The core building blocks of a modern, maintainable frontend are present. The primary failure is in the **integration layer**. The immediate priority is to bridge the gaps between the UI components and the services by implementing the event listeners specified in the new documentation. The secondary priority is to refactor the monolithic `bulk-uploader` and implement a proper `compression-controls` component.
